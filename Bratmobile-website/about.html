            <h4 class="name">Allsion Wolfe</h4>
            <p>
                Wolfe, born november 9, 1969 is a Los Angeles- based singer, songwriter,
                writer, and podcaster. She is one of the founding members and the lead singer of the punk rock band
                Bratmobile,
                she is also one of the leading voices of the riot grrrl movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wolfe and her sister Cindy were born identical twins and grew up in Olympia, Washington.
                Their parents divorced when they were still young children, and they were raised by their mother, Pat
                Shively.
            </p>
            <p>
                A radical feminist and self-described lesbian, Shiverly founded Olympia’s Eastside Women’s Health Clinic
                in
                1981.
            </p>
            <p>
                it was the first women’s clinic in
                Thurston County, and throughout Shively’s two decades of work it was the target of relentless
                anti-abortion
                demostrations.

            <p>
                Neuman, born June 1972, is an American drummer, writer and publisher, originally from the Washington,
                D.C.
                area who has performed in the band Bratmobile and in two other bands which are the Frumpues, and the
                PeeChees.
            </p>
            <p>
                She was a pioneer of the early-to-mid ‘90s riot grrrl movement, penning the zine which coined the phrase
                in
                its
                title.
            </p>
            <p>
                She also co-wrote Girl Germs with Bratmobile singer Allinson Wolfe while the two were students at
                the
                University of Oregon that title later became the name of a bramobile song.

                <p>
                    Erin Smith, born August 16, 1972, in Washington, D.C., is best known for being the guitarist in
                    Bratmobile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smith started her zine Teenage Gang Debs in 1987 with her brother Don.
                    In 1991, she started interning at Sassy magazine, where she wrote articles about independent music
                    and
                    exposed girls to DIY culture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also in 1991, she began to play guitar for Bratmobile with Molly Neuman on the drums and Allison
                    Wolfe
                    on
                    vocals.

        <section class="text__about">
            <h2 class="text__about__title">Origins</h2>
            <p>
                It all began with Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman trying to get out of a gig that Wolfe’s friend
                Calvin
                Johnson,
                an indie musician who also co-owned K Records, had asked them to do in Olympia on Valentine’s Day in
                1991.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although Wolfie knew and admitted that they were a so-called “Fake band” since they didn't play any
                instruments
                then they had still written some songs which they performed a cappella with.
                They ended up agreeing to seek the help of Some Velvet Sidewalk member Robert Christie who let them
                borrow
                rehearsal space and equipment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here Robert advised them to listen to some Ramones for inspiration where in response to the advice
                they
                got
                Wolfe said,
                “Something in me clicked. Like, okay if most boy punk rock bands just listen to the Ramones and
                that’s
                how
                they
                write their songs, then we’ll do the opposite and I won’t listen to any Ramones and that way we’ll
                sound
                different.”

            </p>

            <p>
                And that's how with five original songs, the band played its first show as a two-woman act at
                Olumpia’s
                North Shore Surf Club on February 14, 1991 with Neuman and Wolfe sharing duties on guitar, drums and
                vocals.
                The very next day they recorded the first Kill Rock Stars compilation, which was released later that
                year.

        <section class="text__about">
            <h2 class="text__about__title">Riot grrrl </h2>
            <p>
                The riot grrrl movement originated in the early 1990s, when a group of women from Olympia, Washington,
                held
                a
                meeting about sexism in their local punk scenes. They intentionally used the word “girl” in order to
                focus
                on
                childhood, which is a time where children have the strongest self-esteem and belief in themselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Riot grrrls then took a growling “R”, replacing the “I” in the word as a way to take back the derogatory
                use
                of
                the term.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Riot grrrl musicians/to-be where inspired by the musical drama movie Ladies and Gentlemen, The
                Fabulous
                Stains, which tells the story of a fictional seemingly proto-riot grrrl band.
            </p>
            <p>
                Bratmobile was a first-generation riot grrrl band that became the second-most prominent founding voice
                of
                the
                riot grrrl movement.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1990, University of Oregon students Allison Wolfe and Molly Neuman collaborated on feminist zine Girl
                Germs
                with Washington DC’s Jen Smith, touching on sexism in their local music scenes.

            <h2 class="text__about__title">What is Riot grrrl?</h2>
            <p>
                Because we girls want to create mediums that speak to US.
                We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine, boy punk after
                boy punk after boy… Because we need to talk to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                Communication and inclusion are key. We will never know if we don't break the code of
                silence… Because in every form of media we see ourselves slapped,
                decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, tricialized, pushed, ignored,
                stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot,
                choked and killed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and
                reach
                out to each other without being threatened by
                this sexist society and our day to day bullshit.
